	abstract = {Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterised by loss of muscular atonia and prominent motor behaviours during REM sleep. RBD can cause sleep disruption and severe injuries for the patient or bed partner. The disorder is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy. In many cases, the symptoms of RBD precede other symptoms of these neurodegenerative disorders by several years. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that RBD is associated with abnormalities of electroencephalographic activity, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive, perceptual, and autonomic functions. RBD might be a stage in the development of neurodegenerative disorders and increased awareness of this could lead to substantial advances in knowledge of mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

	abstract = {Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia manifested by vivid, often frightening dreams associated with simple or complex motor behavior during REM sleep. Patients appear to "act out their dreams," in which the exhibited behaviors mirror the content of the dreams. Management of RBD involves counseling about safety measures in the sleep environment; in those at risk for injury, clonazepam and/or melatonin is usually effective. In this article, the authors present a detailed review of the clinical and polysomnographic features, differential diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, management strategies, and pathophysiologic mechanisms of RBD. They then review the literature and their institutional experience of RBD associated with neurodegenerative disease, particularly Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The evolving data suggests that RBD may have clinical diagnostic and pathophysiologic significance in isolation and when associated with neurodegenerative disease.},

The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation. Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used. We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship—in terms of both similarities and important differences—to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume.},

	abstract = {Argumentation is a vital aspect of intelligent behaviour by humans. It provides the means for comparing
	information by analysing pros and cons when trying to make a decision. Formalising argumentation in
	computational environment has become a topic of increasing interest in artificial intelligence research
	over the last decade.
	Computational argumentation involves reasoning with uncertainty by making use of logic in order
	to formalize the presentation of arguments and counterarguments and deal with conflicting information.
	A common assumption for logic-based argumentation is that an argument is a pair < $\Phi$ $\alpha$ > where $\Phi$ is
	a consistent set which is minimal for entailing a claim $\alpha$. Different logics provide different definitions
	for consistency and entailment and hence give different options for formalising arguments and counterarguments.
	The expressivity of classical propositional logic allows for complicated knowledge to be
	represented but its computational cost is an issue. This thesis is based on monological argumentation
	using classical propositional logic [12] and aims in developing algorithms that are viable despite the
	computational cost. The proposed solution adapts well established techniques for automated theorem
	proving, based on resolution and connection graphs. A connection graph is a graph where each node is
	a clause and each arc denotes there exist complementary disjuncts between nodes. A connection graph
	allows for a substantially reduced search space to be used when seeking all the arguments for a claim
	from a given knowledgebase. In addition, its structure provides information on how its nodes can be linked
	with each other by resolution, providing this way the basis for applying algorithms which search for
	arguments by traversing the graph. The correctness of this approach is supported by theoretical results,
	while experimental evaluation demonstrates the viability of the algorithms developed. In addition, an
	extension of the theoretical work for propositional logic to first-order logic is introduced.},
